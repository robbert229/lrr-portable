# lrr-portable

A decompilation and portable reconstruction of **Lego Rock Raiders** (1999).
The goal is a native Linux port using SDL3/miniwin, with a Windows reference
build for comparison against the original. I would currently classify it as a
vibe-coded slop fest, however things are developing rapidly. I hope to have it
in a playable state before the end of November 2026.

## Decompilation status

Verified **2026-11-04** with MSVC 5.0 and Reccmp:

**47.77% game-only binary-matching progress.** Reccmp maps **2,116 / 2,138
functions (98.97%)**, with **48.27% accuracy** among mapped functions.
[Report details and reproduction](docs/coverage/reccmp.md).

The [source ledger](docs/coverage/README.md) records **2,288 / 2,564 functions
(89.2%) with source citations**, plus 271 runtime/import functions and 5 other
entries. Source coverage and binary similarity measure different things;
neither guarantees correct gameplay.

## What works, what remains

The focus so far has been on roughly implementing every single function. As a
result the game is currently unplayable. Most systems are roughly implemented,
but not in a functional state.

The menus partially work, however defects exist in scrolling, and animations.

GamePlay has a lot of work that needs to be done.

## Build and run

Requires a legally owned game copy, CMake, a C++ compiler, and SDL3 development
headers. Game assets are not included. Place the game assets into the 
`reference` folder.

```sh
$ ls reference/
CLGen.dat  D3DRM.DLL  LegoRR0.wad  LegoRR.exe  legoRR-stub.log  Saves
CLGen.exe  Data       LegoRR1.wad  LegoRR.icd  Readme.txt
```

You can then generate the report, and run:

```sh
make reccmp-report
make reccmp-run
```
